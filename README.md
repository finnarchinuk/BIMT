# BIMT
implementation of brain inspired modular training


This is an attempt to implement "Seeing is Believing: Brain Inspired Modular Training" in Tensorflow
https://kindxiaoming.github.io/pdfs/BIMT.pdf
There is code there (and it didn't occur to me until right now to see whether code was available).

The BIMT.py script contains the relevant code, but a well documented notebook is coming.

Future work is to integrate networkx to position neurons more dynamically.
